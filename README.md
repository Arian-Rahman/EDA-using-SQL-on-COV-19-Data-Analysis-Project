# EDA-using-SQL-on-COV-19-Data-Analysis-Project

This is an EDA using SQL where i tried to get some insights into the the data and also get myself familier with the data.
Later i created a few views to make visuals on Tableau .


Original Dataset link  -> https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Instrucitons on getting the Dataset ready for this analysis : 
    I have provided the Deaths table data,but for the Vaccine data ;
      1. Download the complete dataset from the link above.
      2. Open in excell and delete all columns starting from right after location and date upto the Z column.
      3. While deleting the columns, make sure you have key columns to join the two tables on .
      4. You might need to convert the 'date' column using Convert->numbers->Date(choose the first option) in excell 
      5. Save the data to CSV format 
      
I made a `covid` database in Bigquerry and then made deaths and vac tables on it. In order to follow along the project,do the same.
